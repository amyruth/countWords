//countWords
=

Code project from the Epicodus learnhowtoprogram.com website.

Counts the appearance of each word in a text and lists them in descending order of appearance(if I'm lucky).

9/17/2014 Made some progress! Added code to count the words, but found out at random that the removePunctuation function doesn't strip out multiple punctuation marks like ??? and ...
Must work on that.
